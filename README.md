## Notes on using Coq for B522 ##

These notes give a commented trans-coding of the Isabelle/HOL
examples in [the class
notes](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10275252/IntroPLTheory.pdf) for
[B522](http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/classes/spring2015/csci/b522-jsiek/).
They're designed as lecture notes and reference materials for the
Coq tutorial sessions rather than as stand-alone notes.
